This is my personal fork/build of dwm. 

It is modified minimally with the following patches:
- fakefullscreen
- fullgaps
- pertag
- systray
- centerbar

I keep the upstream master branch from suckless.org in a separate branch (upstream-master) and I plan to pull from the upstream for only that branch. Then, try merging/rebasing my local master on the upstream master.

I track both a config.h and a config.def.h to use the former for only my own cosmetic configurations such as the colors, the fonts, the hotkeys, client and tag rules and the latter to keep clean so that the future patches I may consider will apply more easily.
